<p>
  It looks like we've got all the information we need from you. There's only
  three things left to do.
</p>

<h5>Visit the Membership Desk</h5>
<p>
  Your next stop is the membership desk, located in the classroom. Give the
  volunteers on duty your name, and they'll issue your keyfob.
</p>

<h5>Pay Your Dues</h5>

<p>
  Out of concern for your digital privacy, we do not want you to enter
  your credit card or bank information into any of the publicly-available
  computers in our shop. Instead, we ask that you return home, sign into our
  membership dashboard with the account credentials you just created, and enter
  payment from the privacy and security of your own home. Your keyfob will activate
  when your payment goes through, and then you'll be able to come and go as you please.
</p>

<h5>Attend Orientation</h5>

<p>
  We regularly hold orientation sessions for new members. It's a good way to
  get to know the shop managers and meet other new members. Plus, if you stay
  for Woodshop orientation, which is usually held on the same night, you'll get
  training and clearance to use our most powerful woodworking tools.
