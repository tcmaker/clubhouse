          This is the new Twin Cities Maker member dashboard. In time, you
          will be able to manage your dues and contact information, report
          broken tools, and meet all of your other bureaucratic needs. For the
          time being, however, we're using it to gradually re-open the shop.

        <p>
          Until things settle down, you'll be able to reserve <strong>one time slot</strong>
          per day, during which you will be able to work in a single area of
          the shop. Each timeslot is <strong>three hours long</strong>. At the start of your
          timeslot, your keyfob will be automatically activated, and you'll be able to enter
          and the shop as normal. At the end of your timeslot, however, we'll lock
          your keyfob until your next timeslot begins.
        </p>
