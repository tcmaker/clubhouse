      <p>
        As an area manager, you have the authority to close your shop during
        as many timeslots as you would like. Such power!
      </p>
      <p>
        During a closed timeslot, it is not possible for members to reserve
        time in your shop, and any existing reservations will be canceled.
        Clubhouse will automatically email the affected members, informing
        them of the cancelation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can re-open a canceled timeslot any time you like, but it is not
        possible to restore any reservations you canceled when you first closed
        it.
